# **Conclusions**

•	We can see that some cities are preforming well to achieve their target as compare to other thus we have the area of improvement.

•	Surat City is Doing well as compare to others with 73% of on time delivery, completing 76% on in full target.

•	We can see that some customers are consistently below their OTIF targets, while others are much closer or even exceeding them.

•	The overall LIFR is about 66%, meaning about two-thirds of order lines are delivered in full.

•	The overall VOFR is about 97%, indicating that nearly all ordered volume is being delivered, even if some lines are not completely filled.

•	This table shows that most products have a LIFR in the mid-60% range, but their VOFR is much higher, close to 97%.

•	This suggests that while some lines are not fully delivered, the shortfall per line is relatively small.

•	This table shows that most products have a LIFR in the mid-60% range, but their VOFR is much higher, close to 97%.

•	This suggests that while some lines are not fully delivered, the shortfall per line is relatively small.

•	LIFR patterns: Most products show fluctuating LIFR performance over time, with values typically ranging between 40-80%. You can see periods of better and worse line fill performance.

•	VOFR patterns: Volume fill rates are much more stable and consistently high (80-100%), showing that even when lines aren't completely filled, the volume shortfall is minimal.
